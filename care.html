              WHY EVEN CARE IF GOD EXISTS?
            </p>

            <p>

              Who cares if God exists? So what if God is the reason we exist? Why
              does it even matter?

              WORLD RELIGIONS LIKE CHRISTIANITY
            </p>

            <p>

              Many people discount miracles because they don't fit into their
              philosophical worldview. For example, many prominent atheists reject
              the historical basis for Jesus's resurrection not due to the lack of historical
              evidence, but due to their philosophical presuppositions that miracles
              cannot happen. However, if there is a God, it already seems plausible that any
              religion like this could be true.

            </p>

            <p>

              For example, Genesis 1:1 states "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
              To prove this verse to be true using observational evidence and
              logical inference (as I have in my cosmological argument section)
              would lend credibility to the rest of the Bible. After all, if the most
              spectactular miracle already occurred, aren't the other miracles
              in the Bible at least possible?

            </p>

            <p>

              To accept that miracles in the Bible could be possible would force
              the inquirer to inspect the miracle claims of the Bible with at least
              a partially open mind. And miracle claims are central to the Christian faith;
              Paul writes to the Corinthians:

            </p>

            <p>

              "And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so
              is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses
              about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ
              from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.
              <span class = "secret" id = "secret6">For if the dead are not raised,</span> then Christ has not been raised either.
              And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are
              still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
              If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied."

            </p>
