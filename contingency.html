              THE CAUSAL ARGUMENT FOR THE CONTINGENCY OF THE UNIVERSE
            </p>


            <p>

              This argument seeks to prove the contingency of the universe using
              the principle of causality.

            </p>

              IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS FOR THIS ARGUMENT

            </p>

            <p>

              Contingent being: A being which does not exist by neccesity of its
              own nature, and thus relies on external reasons for its existance.

            </p>

            <p>

              Necessary being: A being whose existance is grounded in the necessity
              of its own nature; it is impossible for it to not exist, as its nature
              prevents it from being so.

            </p>

            <p>

              The Universe: The natural world, time, space, matter, energy, and
              all natural processes such as quantum fluctuations, which we observe.

            </p>

            <p>

              Strong Causality: Every state of the universe is wholly determined
              by the others.

            </p>

            <p>

              Weak Causality: Every state of the universe is neither wholly determined
              nor wholly undetermined by the others.

            </p>

            <p>

              Non-Causality: Every state of the universe is wholly undetermined by
              the others.

            </p>

              THE ARGUMENT

            </p>

            <p>

              Premise 1: Either the universe obeys strong causality, weak causality,
              or non-causality.

            </p>

            <p>

              Premise 2: If the universe obeys strong causality or weak causality,
              it is contingent.

            </p>

            <p>

              Premise 3: The universe does not obey non-causality.

            </p>

            <p>

              Conclusion: Therefore, the universe is contingent.

            </p>

              OBJECTIONS TO THE SECOND PREMISE

            </p>

            <div class = "quote">

              <p>

                Why must the universe be contingent if it obeys strong causality?

              </p>

            </div>

            <p>

              If the universe obeys strong causality, it means every state is
              completely contingent on the next. Even assuming that the universe
              is totally eternal (which contradicts modern cosmology) and therefore
              there are infinite states, the problem of infinite regress still applies:
              an infinite chain of non-reasons cannot come together to make an actual reason.
              Therefore, if strong casuality is true, the universe is contingent.

            </p>

              <p>

                Why must the universe be contingent if it obeys weak causality?

            </div>

            <p>

              If the universe obeys weak causality, it means the arrangement of every state is
              completely contingent on the next. At this point, we must observe that
              the universe is a composite being, meaning it is composed of smaller parts.
              If all these parts were arranged such that none were in causal relation
              with each other anymore, the universe would seize to exist, even though
              the arrangement is the only thing that has changed. Even assuming that the universe
              is totally eternal (which contradicts modern cosmology) and therefore
              there are infinite states, the problem of infinite regress still applies:
              an infinite chain of non-reasons cannot come together to make an actual reason.
              Therefore, if weaak casuality is true, the universe is contingent.

              OBJECTIONS TO THE THIRD PREMISE

            </p>

            <div class = "quote">

              <p>

                Why can't the universe obey non-causality?

              </p>

            </div>

            <p>

              If the universe obeys non causality, it means that the arrangement and
              existance of every state is not dependent on the other states. This is
              clearly false; when I push a ball down a hill, it doesn't go down the hill
              because there are an incomprehensibly large set of causally independent
              states that just happened to assemble such that they create the illusion
              of causality; such a thing would be a massive violation of Occam's razor.
