              THE TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT
            </p>

            <p>
              This argument is an attempt to provide strong evidence for the existance
              of God using probabilities and logical inferences based on the fine
              tuning of the universe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Scientists have found recently that the universe's nature is determined
              by various constants that appear finely tuned for life.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, the Gravitational Constant is finely tuned to a degree of 10<span class=sup>60</span>,
              meaning that if the value of the Gravitational Constant were off by
              a factor of 1 in 10<span class=sup>60</span> then the universe would
              have either 1) collapsed and not formed any stars of 2) expanded
              too quickly and not formed any stars. In any case, the Gravitational
              Constant seems fine-tuned to allow for life.
            </p>

            <p>
              To put this in perspective, you have approximately 10<span class=sup>15</span>
              cells in your body, and the amount of seconds between the Big Bang and
              now is about 10<span class=sup>20</span> seconds. The fact that the
              Gravitational Constant is so finely tuned is beyond comprehension.
            </p>

            <p>
              But it doesn't stop there; there are more finely tuned constants.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, the Cosmological Constant is finely tuned to a degree of 10<span class=sup>120</span>,
              and the ratios of matter and energy in the universe is finely tuned
              to an incomprehensible degree of 10<span class=sup>10<span class=sup>123</span></span>.
            </p>

            <p>
              What could possibly explain this?
            </p>

              THE ARGUMENT
            </p>

            <p>
              Premise 1: There are three possible explanations for the fine-tuned
              nature of the universe: Necessity (the universe had to be this way),
              Random Chance (we just got lucky), or Design (a cosmic designer).
            </p>

            <p>
              Premise 2: Random Chance and Necessity are less plausible explanations
              than Design.
            </p>

            <p>
              Conclusion: Therefore, there exists a cosmic designer.
