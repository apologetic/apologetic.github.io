              THE TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT
            </p>

            <p>
              This argument is an attempt to provide strong evidence for the existance
              of God using probabilities and logical inferences based on the fine
              tuning of the universe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Scientists have found recently that the universe's nature is determined
              by various constants that appear finely tuned for life.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, the Gravitational Constant is finely tuned to a degree of 10<span class=sup>60</span>,
              meaning that if the value of the Gravitational Constant were off by
              a factor of 1 in 10<span class=sup>60</span> then the universe would
              have either 1) collapsed and not formed any stars of 2) expanded
              too quickly and not formed any stars. In any case, the Gravitational
              Constant seems fine-tuned to allow for life.
            </p>

            <p>
              To put this in perspective, you have approximately 10<span class=sup>15</span>
              cells in your body, and the amount of seconds between the Big Bang and
              now is about 10<span class=sup>20</span> seconds. The fact that the
              Gravitational Constant is so finely tuned is beyond comprehension.
            </p>

            <p>
              But it doesn't stop there; there are more finely tuned constants.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, the Cosmological Constant is finely tuned to a degree of 10<span class=sup>120</span>,
              and the ratios of matter and energy in the universe is finely tuned
              to an incomprehensible degree of 10<span class=sup>10<span class=sup>123</span></span>.
            </p>

            <p>
              What could possibly explain this?
            </p>

            <p class = "ptitle">
              THE ARGUMENT
            </p>

            <p>
              Premise 1: There are three possible explanations for the fine-tuned
              nature of the universe: Necessity (the universe had to be this way),
              Random Chance (we just got lucky), or Design (a cosmic designer).
            </p>

            <p>
              Premise 2: Random Chance and Necessity are less plausible explanations
              than Design.
            </p>

            <p>
              Conclusion: Therefore, there a cosmic designer is the most plausible explanation
              for the fine-tuned nature of the universe.
            </p>

              OBJECTIONS TO THE SECOND PREMISE
            </p>

            <div class = "quote">

              <p>

                Why discredit a lucky chance in the first place? We could've just
                gotten very lucky. No reason to run to a cosmic designer.

              </p>

            </div>

            <p>
              When the chances are so astronomically low, it starts looking less
              like a lucky chance and more like the interference of intelligence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Imagine you were having a poker game, and one player had been dealt,
              for the last 20 hands, four Aces. After the 20th hand of four Aces is dealt,
              you get up to shoot the guy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Would you take the player seriously if he said, "But wait, it's possible
              that I just got very, very lucky!"
            </p>

            <p>
              No, <span class = "secret" id = "secret4">you would accuse the player of cheating.</span> In the same way, we are
              faced with astronomical odds with regards the the constants of the
              universe. If the odds are so low, it seems almost impossible that the
              universe is this way due to mere chance, especially since the chance
              of getting a life-permitting Cosmological Constant alone is lower
              than the chance of getting 20 hands of 4 aces in a row. Combined
              with all of the other constants, we have odds so incomprehensibly
              slim that to call it a "lucky chance" is plainly absurd.
            </p>

            <div class = "quote">

              <p>

                A lucky chance is very probable. After all, there is a 1:1 chance
                of finding ourselves in a universe where we are capable of observing
                it. Therefore we should not be surprised that we find ourselves in
                a life permitting universe.

              </p>

            </div>

            <p>

              To say that there is a 1:1 chance of finding ourselves in a universe
              does not actually provide an explanation for why we are actually here.
              It is just a statement of fact. The real question we should ask is
              for what reason we find ourselves in this universe. The answer for
              this is that the universe has been fine-tuned for life.

            </p>

            <p>

              If it has been fine-tuned for life, <em>why</em> is it fine-tuned
              for life?

            </p>

            <p>

              I can't stress this any more; shrugging and saying, "There is a one
              in one chance of finding ourselves in a life permitting universe,"
              does not explain <em>why</em> we are alive. It is just a neutral
              observation that I've obviously already accepted. The question we should
              ask is, "Given the nigh-impossible improbabilities involved," <em>why</em>
              is our universe this way?

            </p>

            <p>

              We can illustrate this with an analogy; imagine you are standing in
              front of a firing squad, tied to the wall. You hear the word, "Fire!"
              and gunshots. Silence. You are not dead. All the trained marksmen
              have missed.

            </p>

            <p>

              The obvious next step is to ask the question, "Why am I alive rather
              than dead, given the absurd improbabilities of being alive?" It is
              completely valid to say, "There is a one in one chance of me finding
              myself alive." However, this does not answer the actual question:
              "Why did the marksmen miss?"

            <div class = "quote">

              <p>

                What about the idea that there are an infinite amount of worlds
                that exist causally seperate from one another and we just happen
                to be in the one that supports life (AKA Multiverse Theory)

              </p>

            </div>

            <p>

              First of all, this explanation violates Occam's Razor. Why dream
              up literally an infinite amount of worlds just to explain our own?
              To do so would be making lots of unnecessary assumptions, more so
              than postulating a singular entity like God.

            </p>

            <p>

              Second of all, this explanation is not verifiable. We have no indication
              of the multiverse anywhere; at least for God, there are miracles
              with historical evidence.

            </p>

            <p>

              Third of all, the multiverse still calls for an explanation. Why does
              the multiverse consist of every possible world rather than the same
              world copied over and over? For whatever is creating the multiverse
              to exist, it would require fine-tuning to create the results we
              have described, unless you were to suggest that the multiverse-generator
              were necessary, in which it is essentially analogous to God.

            <div class = "quote">

                But high improbabilities happen all the time. It's unlikely that
                people win the lottery, but people still win the lottery. In addition,
                if I pull out a random hand from a deck of cards, there are very low chances
                that I got that random hand. Therefore we shouln't be shocked by high
                improbabilities.

              </p>

            </div>

            <p>

              This represents a total disrespect for statistics. The chances of
              a single person winning the lottery are very slim, yes. But the chance
              of some random person winning the lottery, which is what this objection
              is raising as "highly improbable," is in fact a 1:1 chance. It is guaranteed
              that some <em>random</em> person will win the lottery, because a feature
              of the lottery is that somebody will always win. But to point at a specific
              person and say, "That person will win the lottery," is highly improbable.

            </p>

            <p>

              Similarly, there is a 1:1 chance of pulling a random set of cards
              out of a deck of cards. What is highly improbable is pulling a random
              set of cards out and expecting a specific set.
