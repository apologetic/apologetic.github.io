              THE LEIBNIZIAN COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT
            </p>


            <p>
              This argument is a more airtight form of the normal cosmological
              argument, developed by Gottfried Leibniz, which appeals to the
              fact that things need reasons to exists (based on the Principle
              of Sufficient Reason).
            </p>

            <p>
              We live in a world of contingent things, that is, everything we see
              only exists because some reason led to its existance. If your parents
              didn't exist, you wouldn't exist. If the big bang didn't happen,
              the planet wouldn't have formed. There is no reason to believe that
              the universe itself doesn't behave this way; so if the universe
              has a reason to exist, why does it exist? The answer, I argue,
              is found in God.
            </p>

              IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS FOR THIS ARGUMENT

            </p>

            <p>

              Contingent being: A being which does not exist by neccesity of its
              own nature, and thus relies on external reasons for its existance.

            </p>

            <p>

              Necessary being: A being whose existance is grounded in the necessity
              of its own nature; it is impossible for it to not exist, as its nature
              prevents it from being so.

            </p>

            <p>

              The Universe: The natural world, time, space, matter, energy, and
              all natural processes such as quantum fluctuations, which we observe.

            </p>


            <p class = "ptitle">

              THE ARGUMENT

            </p>

            <p>

              Premise 1: Anything that exists has an explanation of its
              existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in
              an external explanation.

            </p>

            <p class="para">

              This premise should be clear to anybody seeking truth. It's a fundamental
              principle of scientific inquiry, and almost any inquiry, to ask why
              things are the way they are. Whenever we see something, it calls for an
              explanation. Now, either the reason the thing exists is the necessity of its own nature,
              which means that its nature necessitates that it must exist, or it
              does not exist by necessity of its own nature. If it doesn't exist
              by necessity of its own nature, then it is contingent, either on itself
              or on something else. However, if something is contingent on itself,
              that would lead to circular reasoning, as you would be presupposing
              the existance of itself before you explain its existance, which is
              absurd. So something that is contingent must be contingent, to a certain
              degree, on an external reason.

            </p>

            <p>

              Premise 2: If the universe has an explanation for its existence, then
              that explanation is grounded in a necessary being (God).

            </p>

            <p class="para">

              The universe is contingent (see my Causal Argument), so it must
              have an external explanation. Now, if it requires an external explanation,
              that explanation could be something that also is contingent. However,
              this would lead to an infinite regress.

            </p>

            <p class = "para">

              Our goal is to find a reason why the universe exists, and an infinite
              chain of contingent reasons does not answer this. Assume a friend were
              to walk up to you and punch you, and when you asked him why he punched
              you, he said this:

            </p>

            <p class = "para">

              "My reason is that I have another reason."

            </p>

            <p class = "para">

              Then when you asked him what that other reason was, he said that
              it was that he had another reason for that. And when you pushed further,
              he said that he had another reason. Ad infinitum.

            </p>

            <p class = "para">

              Even if your friend said to refer to "another reason" infinity times,
              it transparently is not a reason. An infinite amount of non-reasons
              put together does not make a reason.

            </p>

            <p class = "para">

              As atheist philosopher David Hume said,

            </p>

            <p class = "para">

              "But you cannot procced after this matter, in infinitum, you must
              at least terminate in some fact, which is present to your memory or
              senses; or must allow that your belief is entirely without foundation."

            </p>

            <p class = "para">

              So, the explanation of the universe cannot be a contingent chain,
              but a necessary being which has its explanation of its existance
              grounded in its nature.

            </p>

            <p>

              Premise 3: The universe exists.

            </p>

            <p class="para">

              I'd imagine this isn't too controversial.

            </p>

            <p>

              Conclusion: Therefore, a necessary being (God) exists.

              OBJECTIONS TO THE FIRST PREMISE

            </p>


            <div class = "quote">

              <p>

                This argument seems to depend on the fact that time is tensed.
                What about B-theory time, which proposes that the past, present,
                and future all exist at once, and therefore nothing comes into
                existance because all past and future states of the universe
                exist already? Doesn't this premise depend on objects having
                causes and coming into existance?

              </p>

            </div>

            <p>

              When I say that everything that exists needs a reason, I do not suppose
              that it is a temporal cause that happens before the object in question
              comes into existance. I am simply stating that things need reasons to
              exist, nothing more, nothing less. Even a 4-dimensional block universe
              described by B-theory time still calls for a reason as to why it exists.

            </p>


            <p class = "ptitle">

              OBJECTIONS TO THE SECOND PREMISE

            </p>


              <div class = "quote">

                <p>

                  But God can't exist, because an omnipotent being can't make
                  a rock so big that he can't lift it, therefore meaning he is not
                  omnipotent, and therefore making God (an omnipotent being)
                  impossible!

                </p>

              </div>

              <p>

                You'll notice that this argument does not prove that an omnipotent
                being exists. It proves that a <em>necessary</em> being exists. However,
                that objection still does not rule out the possibility of an omnipotent
                (all powerful) being. Most philosophers don't crudely define
                omnipotence to be "the ability to do anything" because that leaves
                room for paradoxes. Rather, most define omnipotence as the ability to
                do anything that is <em>possible.</em>

              </p>

              <p>

                Asking if God can create a rock so big that he can't lift it is like
                asking if God could create a square circle, or a married bachelor,
                or the smell of blue. All are logically
                impossible questions; they're as valid as asking "could God 11 a giraffe?"
                Why does it matter if God is unable to provide an answer for
                a question that doesn't make any sense in the first place?

              </p>

              <p>

                In fact, for an atheist to consider such a question as logical
                is a critical failure in their entire system of logic; if one
                illogical statement is held to be true, then anything illogical
                can be held to be true.

                  Okay, I get that the cause has to be necessary. But why can't it
                  be a necessary <em>substance</em>? Why must the neccesary cause
                  be conscious?

                </p>

              </div>

              <p>

                A necessary substance cannot act on its own- in order for a substance
                to do anything, it must be caused to do something. But if it is caused
                to do something, it would either be caused by a necessary substance
                or a necessary being. If it was caused by a necessary substance,
                ad infinitum, then it would simply result in an infinite regress,
                thereby requiring us to terminate in a necessary being, which can
                make decisions independently.

                OBJECTIONS TO THE THIRD PREMISE

              <div class = "quote">

                <p>

                  Quantum physics and the measurement problem seem to prove that
                  the universe only exists in our mind. Doesn't idealism refute this
                  argument?

                </p>

              </div>

              <p>

                Idealism absolutely does not refute this argument. Even if the universe
                is mental, that does not mean that it doesn't exist, but simply
                exists in a different state.

              <p class = "ptitle">

                OBJECTIONS TO THE CONCLUSION

              </p>

              <div class = "quote">

                <p>

                  You may have proven that a God exists, but this doesn't prove
                  that <em>YOUR</em> God exists! Why can't this necessary being
                  be a Spaghetti Monster, or Xenu, or any other idea of God?
                  Why does it have to be YOUR God?

                </p>

              </div>

              <p>

                This argument doesn't aspire to prove that "my" God exists, so
                this is no actual objection. But to answer the question, I believe
                in a general God because of general theistic arguments like this.
                To decide what specific God I want to believe it, I examine the
                evidence for each religion and decide which one seems the most reasonable.

              </p>

              <p>

                Furthermore, a God like a Flying Spaghetti Monster wouldn't work. Why?
                To have created time, space, matter, energy, at the complexity that we
                observe, the God must be timeless, spaceless, immaterial, enormously powerful,
                and personal. The Spaghetti Monster must not be made of matter, must not
                occupy space, must not be bound to time, have the power to create everything,
                and have intelligence. But at this point, the Spaghetti Monster sounds less
                like a monster made of spaghetti and more like God.
