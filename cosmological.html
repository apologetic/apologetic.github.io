              THE LEIBNIZIAN COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT
            </p>


            <p>
              This argument is a more airtight form of the normal cosmological
              argument, developed by Gottfried Leibniz, which appeals to the
              fact that things need reasons to exists (based on the Principle
              of Sufficient Reason).
            </p>

            <p>
              We live in a world of contingent things, that is, everything we see
              only exists because some reason led to its existance. If your parents
              didn't exist, you wouldn't exist. If the big bang didn't happen,
              the planet wouldn't have formed. There is no reason to believe that
              the universe itself doesn't behave this way; so if the universe
              has a reason to exist, why does it exist? The answer, I argue,
              is found in God.

              IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS FOR THIS ARGUMENT

            </p>

            <p>

              Contingent being: A being whose existance depends on external reasons.

            </p>

            <p>

              Necessary being: A being whose existance is a necessity; it is impossible

              THE ARGUMENT

            </p>

            <p>

              Premise 1: Anything that exists has an explanation of its
              existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in
              an external explanation.

            </p>

            <p>

              Premise 2: The universe has an explanation for its existence, and
              that explanation is grounded in a necessary being (God).

            </p>

            <p>

              Premise 3: The universe exists.

            </p>

            <p>

              Conclusion: Therefore, a necessary being (God) exists.

              <p>

                Why does everything that exists need a reason or cause?

              </p>

            </div>

            <p>

              To suggest that some things that exist don't exist for a reason
              would undermine the very notion of scientific inquiry, and any
              form of empirical study. What scientist has ever looked at the
              world and said, "There's no reason it's there; it just is."

            <div class = "quote">

              <p>

                This argument seems to depend on the fact that time is tensed.
                What about B-theory time, which proposes that the past, present,
                and future all exist at once, and therefore nothing comes into
                existance because all past and future states of the universe
                exist already? Doesn't this premise depend on objects having
                causes and coming into existance?

              </p>

            </div>

            <p>

              When I say that everything that exists needs a reason, I do not suppose
              that it is a temporal cause that happens before the object in question
              comes into existance. I am simply stating that things need reasons to
              exist, nothing more, nothing less. Even a 4-dimensional block universe
              described by B-theory time still calls for a reason as to why it exists.

              OBJECTIONS TO THE SECOND PREMISE

            </p>

            <div class = "quote">

              <p>

                Why is it that a necessary being (God) needs to exist for the
                universe to exist?

              </p>

            </div>

            <p>

              The universe can't cause itself. Therefore, its cause must come from
              something else.

            </p>


              <div class = "quote">

                <p>

                  If everything needs a reason to exist, then why doesn't God need
                  a reason to exist?

                </p>

              </div>

              <p>

                Actually, God <em>does</em> have a reason to exist. A common confusion
                is that when people read "reason to exist" they assume that that reason
                must be an external reason. However, there is no reason why an entity
                couldn't be "necessary," meaning it needs no external reason to exist
                because it is impossible for it not to exist either way. This is why
                the distinction is made between reasons that are external explanations
                and internal explanations in the first premise (either in the necessity
                of its own nature on in an external explanation).

              </p>

              <div class = "quote">

                <p>

                  If God can exist as a "necessary" entity, why can't the <em>UNIVERSE</em>
                  be "necessary" as well?

                </p>

              </div>

              <p>

                The definition of a neccesary entity is an entity that cannot fail to exist (
                this is why a necessary entity does not need an external cause). Now,
                think: does the universe fit this criteria? For the universe to be
                necessary, it must be <em>unchanging</em> and logically impossible to not
                exist. First off, the universe clearly is not unchanging. It's possible
                that if the universal constants had been different, then the entire universe
                could have been completely different or even hazardous to life. Even
                more significantly, it's possible that the universe might not have
                existed. So, obviously the universe can't be necessary, but it must
                be contingent. Therefore,
                some other necessary thing must have externally caused it.

                <p>

                  Why can't an infinite chain of contingent beings have caused
                  the universe to exist?

                </p>

              </div>

              <p>

                Our goal is to find a reason why the universe exists, and an infinite
                chain of contingent reasons does not answer this. Assume a friend were
                to walk up to you and punch you, and when you asked him why he punched
                you, he said this:

              </p>

              <p>

                "My reason is that I have another reason."

              </p>

              <p>

                Then when you asked him what that other reason was, he said that
                it was that he had another reason for that. And when you pushed further,
                he said that he had another reason. Ad infinitum.

              </p>

              <p>

                Even if your friend said to refer to "another reason" infinity times,
                it transparently is not a reason. An infinite amount of non-reasons
                put together does not make a reason.

              </p>

              <p>

                As atheist philosopher David Hume said,

              </p>

              <p>

                "But you cannot procced after this matter, in infinitum, you must
                at least terminate in some fact, which is present to your memory or
                senses; or must allow that your belief is entirely without foundation."

              </p>

              <div class = "quote">

                <p>

                  But God can't exist, because an omnipotent being can't make
                  a rock so big that he can't lift it, therefore meaning he is not
                  omnipotent, and therefore making God (an omnipotent being)
                  impossible!

                </p>

              </div>

              <p>

                You'll notice that this argument does not prove that an omnipotent
                being exists. It proves that a <em>necessary</em> being exists. However,
                that objection still does not rule out the possibility of an omnipotent
                (all powerful) being. Most philosophers don't crudely define
                omnipotence to be "the ability to do anything" because that leaves
                room for paradoxes. Rather, most define omnipotence as the ability to
                do anything that is <em>possible.</em>

              </p>

              <p>

                Asking if God can create a rock so big that he can't lift it is like
                asking if God could create a square circle, or a married bachelor,
                or the smell of blue. All are logically
                impossible questions; they're as valid as asking "could God 11 a giraffe?"
                Why does it matter if God is unable to provide an answer for
                a question that doesn't make any sense in the first place?

              </p>

              <p>

                In fact, for an atheist to consider such a question as logical
                is a critical failure in their entire system of logic; if one
                illogical statement is held to be true, then anything illogical
                can be held to be true.

                  Okay, I get that the cause has to be necessary. But why can't it
                  be a necessary <em>substance</em>? Why must the neccesary cause
                  be conscious?

              </div>

              <p>

                A necessary substance cannot act on its own- in order for a substance
                to do anything, it must be caused to do something. But if it is caused
                to do something, it would either be caused by a necessary substance
                or a necessary being. If it was caused by a necessary substance,
                ad infinitum, then it would simply result in an infinite regress,
                thereby requiring us to terminate in a necessary being.

                  Quantum physics and the measurement problem seem to prove that

                Idealism absolutely does not refute this argument. Even if the universe

                exists in a different state.

                  You may have proven that a God exists, but this doesn't prove
                  that <em>YOUR</em> God exists! Why can't this necessary being

                This argument doesn't aspire to prove that "my" God exists, so
                this is no actual objection. But to answer the question, I believe
                in a general God because of general theistic arguments like this.
                To decide what specific God I want to believe it, I examine the
                evidence for each religion and decide which one seems the most reasonable.
